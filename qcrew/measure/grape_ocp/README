This folder contains the necessary files to run a GRAPE-optimised pulse

Introduction
-----------
    GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering is a method to produce optimal control pulses, for 
    high-fidelity unitary transformations on cavity states. Besides GRAPE, there are also 
    SNAP gate and echo-conditional displacement methods to produce optimal unitary 
    transformations.

    This series of code uses the `pygrape` module by YALE, which Yvonne got ahold of. The 
    original code can be found in the QCREW drive, along with some example unitaries
