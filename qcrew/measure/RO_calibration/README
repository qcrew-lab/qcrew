This folder contains 3 scripts to:
    1. Calibrate the DC offset of the acquired readout pulse (calibrate_dc_offset)
    2. Get optimal integration weights for a given readout pulse (int_weight_training)
    3. Calculate discrimination threshold between G and E states (threshold_calculation)

These three scripts must be ran *in this order* every time the length or amplitude of the readout pulse is adjusted or when the time of flight is changed.

The time_diff_calc script calculates the time offset that is hardcoded on the ReadoutTrainer. This value is a parameter of the OPX and doesn't change with time.

To reset to constant integration weights, use the following script in setup_modes.py:

integration_weights = qcp.OptimizedIntegrationWeights(
    length=int(rr.readout_pulse.length / 4)
)
rr.readout_pulse.integration_weights = integration_weights
