This folder contains the necessary files to run a GRAPE-optimised pulse

##### Introduction
-----------
    GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering is a method to produce optimal control pulses, for 
    high-fidelity unitary transformations on cavity states. Besides GRAPE, there are also 
    SNAP gate and echo-conditional displacement methods to produce optimal unitary 
    transformations.

    This series of code uses the `pygrape` module by YALE, which Yvonne got ahold of. The 
    original code can be found in the QCREW drive, along with some example unitaries

##### Available Experiments
-------------
qubit_pulse_calibration
    Is essentially a power rabi experiment using a optimal qubit pi pulse

cavity_pulse_calibration
    Is essentially a displacement power calibration using a optimal displacement 1 pulse

TOF_calibration
    Performs a TOF sweep for the optimal state preparation using a selective qubit pi pulse

number_split
    Is essentially a number split measurement using the optimal state preparation
    UNDER CONSIDERATION TO BE REMOVED
        > Does not yield meaningful information
        > Is identical to the standard number split

wigner function
    Is essentially a wigner measurement using the optimal state preparation
    UNDER CONSIDERATION TO BE REMOVED
        > Does not yield meaningful information
        > Is identical to the standard wigner
